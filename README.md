Instructions :

You will be building the dashboard UI.
Our Customer Experience agents want a dashboard to look up a specific order by its ID. We've provided an API helper function to get order info. 
The left side will have an input and button that takes a single order ID. When the button is clicked, the right side should display the following: The user's name 
A list of the products they ordered - just the product id and the quantity for each. 
Let's try inputting an order ID of 12 first. 
This exercise is more about your thought process than completely finishing the solution, so keep telling us about your thoughts as you work on a solution. 
API Documentation 
fetchOrder(orderId: number) 
This function is already built-in and imported into the your app 
It takes in an order ID param and returns a JS promise with data about the order.
